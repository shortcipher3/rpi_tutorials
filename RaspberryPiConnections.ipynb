        "You've probably used Microsoft Windows at school, you probably know about Apple's OSX - those are two of the most popular operating systems.  You can think of an operating system as software that runs your programs that you interact with.  Linux is a third operating system - it is free software that has been written to be shared, which means you can look at the code and edit it yourself if you wanted to.\n",
        "\n",
        "Operating Systems:\n",
        "* Windows\n",
        "* OSX\n",

        "* Android\n",
        "\n",
        "Since Linux is free it is easy for companies to adapt to their hardware/use case, it may surprise you, but you use Linux a lot.  Some devices that use Linux are:\n",
        "* Raspberry Pi - uses Raspbian Linux\n",
        "* Chromebook - uses Chromium (based on Linux)\n",
        "* Network Router - most network routers use Linux (this is what you have at home to get to the internet)\n",
        "* Websites - one estimate says that 70% of the websites you visit are hosted on Linux servers\n",
        "* Android phones - Android operating system actually comes from Linux\n",
        "* Vivint Smart Home devices (my work) - the cameras and sensors I work with largely are built on Linux\n",
        "\n",
        "Not everything uses an operating system, some computers are a little more barebones, they aren't intended for general purpose use, these would be computers in electronics you have such as a camera, a modern car is estimated to have 50 computers most of which don't run an operating system, you may have heard of Arduino, which doesn't have an operating system.  These computers are often split into two groups: Real-Time Systems and Microcontrollers.\n",

        "## Shell\n",
        "A shell (terminal) is a way to control a computer with text commands, we have played with a few shells to get you up and running.\n",
        "* crosh - the chromium shell, a limited shell for chrome users (read about the commands here: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/terminal-commands-chromebook/ )\n",
        "* bash - bourne again shell, this is probably the most popular shell available so if you want to learn more about shells it is a great one to get started on, I found a good introductory tutorial here: https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/\n",
        "* ssh - secure shell, this is a way of securely connecting with a shell to a computer over a network, typically when you connect it will start up a bash shell, or another kind of shell (sh, csh, dsh, ksh, zsh, etc)\n",

        "Shell is actually another programming language, which is used heavily in system administration for Linux - however you wouldn't want to write very complicated programs in shell.  Python is probably the next language I would start learning after scratch, it is probably good to try it out just so you get an idea of how things can be represented differently.\n",

        "## Webpages\n",
        "There are lots of tools for creating webpages - we used flask, which is a webserver for serving webpages with python.  HTML is great for static webpages, javascript is more complicated but can make your webpages more interactive, python I think is good for interactive things that may control some raspberry pi functions.  You could look up tutorials on each of these languages, but I would probably focus first on the python tutorials above and maybe read a little of the flask tutorial we looked at (just skim it, probably everything won't make sense, but if a heading looks interesting read a little and try to understand what the code snippets are supposed to do).\n",

        "## Raspberry Pi projects\n",
        "There are a lot of websites that talk about raspberry pi projects a lot of these mix hardware and software, which is something the raspberry pi is really good at over a traditional computer.  With no additional hardware I think it is great for learning a little about networking, eg having two computers talk to each other.  If you kind of like programming, but find you don't like networking/internet-of-things - there are actually lots of kinds of programming that don't require that.\n",
